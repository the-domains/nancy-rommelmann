Five days earlier, Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, who had drawn the prophet Mohammed with a bomb in his turban, had a Somali man <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/04/danish-cartoonist-axe-attack" data-href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/04/danish-cartoonist-axe-attack">break down the door of his home with an ax</a>; Westergaard and his five year-old granddaughter survived because police shot and killed the intruder. There had been no unified outcry from the press against the Somali; more, handwringing and equivocation, the thought being that Westerners needed to show more sensitivity toward the Muslim faith.</p><p>“These are the same people who say that if I don’t believe in God I can’t know what morality is,” said Hitchens, making fast work of a half-dozen oysters. “They’ve just dissolved morality completely into relativism by saying actually, occasionally, carving up grandfathers and granddaughters with an ax on New Year’s Eve can be okay if it’s done to protect the reputation of a seventh-century Arabian man who heard voices.”</p><p>Hitchens was in Portland for an event for his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00287KD4Q/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1" data-href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00287KD4Q/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1"><em>God is Not Great</em></a>. I was here because Totten thought I would enjoy meeting Hitchens. I did. I enjoyed watching him shut-up the chattering buffoon at the next table without the man realizing how it had happened; enjoyed the breathless “I love you…” from a woman who, as she passed behind Hitchens’s chair, ran a finger along the shoulders of his suit jacket. I appreciated the suit, summer-weight, heather-blue, so properly tailored I could imagine him sleeping in it on a transcontinental flight and arriving looking ready for the day.</p><p>“I had it made in Vietnam,” he said, when I told him the suit was beautiful. I asked if I might get him a proper fork so he did not have to keep eating his entrée with his oyster fork. I told him about Amanda and the children.</p><p>“Did she think the children would be going to heaven?” Hitchens asked. I told him I believed she did. I appreciated how quickly he saw that the existence of heaven, something he actively did not believe existed, had mattered to Amanda; that her thinking heaven was where she was sending her children might be a factor here.</p><p>I left the lunch early. I needed to buy a suitcase. I was leaving the next morning for Panama, on a business trip with my husband. As the octogenarian owner of the luggage store down the street from Jake’s Grill showed me the advantages of this or that roller-bag, I wondered at the decadence of my leaving Portland, when so much of Amanda’s case was undecided. My husband did not want to hear it. He had too many times watched me get sucked into a story, to the household’s detriment. He understood that as a writer I sometimes slipped into other people’s lives and tragedies, sometimes for months. But he was the one who, one time, had to haul me up and out of a story, <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/news/griefs-gravity-2137787" data-href="http://www.laweekly.com/news/griefs-gravity-2137787">the dying and death of Jesica Santillan</a>, a teenage girl who received a mismatched heart transplant at Duke University Medical Center, the writing of which left me despondent to the point of blankness, for months I was no one’s wife or mother; I wanted to be left alone with the dead girl, who in my mind was alive and with me, at the bottom of the sea, where we were having tea. Din was not going to let me go through that again;<em>he</em>was not going to go through that again. And so to the question of my going or not going to Panama: I was going.</p><p>The two-hundred-mile drive between Panama City and the mountain town of Boquete took seven hours. There were chickens and burros and horses on the sometimes two-lane Pan American Highway. Boys walked roadside swinging machetes. For about a mile, the dividing line between cars going in opposite directions was a strip of fire. Din had gotten the rental car up to about fifty-five on a straightaway when a motorcycle, no more than 250cc, pulled alongside us. The driver was maybe fifteen, and holding him around the waist was a girl his age, maybe four-foot-ten, black hair loose and flying, wearing tiny shorts and engineer boots, in the US you might have called her a hot little punk and she might taunted you, showing you her tongue ring as she sped past. Here, she stared straight ahead. She might have kept one hand on the handlebars of the bicycle the motorcycle was towing, but I don’t think she did. I think the kid on the bicycle held on to the motorcycle seat. This crew overtook our car on the left doing sixty, the bicycle canted in a way that looked as though it should not have stayed upright, I expected we might see the kid curled in gravel shoulder up ahead but we didn’t. None of them died that day, as far as I knew. We came close to dying a few days later, came within maybe four feet of sliding off a volcanic pass as we crossed the country from west to east, it was raining hard and the light was jungle-green and watery, and as my husband made a turn the road was gone, slipped off in a chunk twice the length of our car. Din cut the car to the mountainside, and our tires held in the yellow mud. We continued ascending, we had no choice, but for an hour not one of the four of us in the car spoke, we each metabolized the fear in our way, and then we were cresting, the jungle-light became sunlight, the rain stopped and the tension in our bodies started to fizz off, and then we saw a man in the road waving his arms. He came to our window, and when we asked in bad Spanish what happened, he punched one fist into his open palm, and again. Ten minutes later a road worker waved us past a car whose front half was crushed under the semi-truck it had slid under. Men were trying to pry open the driver’s compartment with their hands but there was no way.</p><p>undefined</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1615599e-6082-452d-9e95-468b46b4e43b.png"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/07e4a5a8-5178-47f4-8a8d-0f88a3a7b42a.png"></div></article></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="40"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="41"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="42"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="43"><span data-reactid="44"><!-- react-empty: 45 --><h2 data-reactid="46"><a data-reactid="47"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="48"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="49"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="50"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="51"></div></section></div></div>

There had been no unified outcry from the press against the Somali; more, handwringing and equivocation, the thought being that Westerners needed to show more sensitivity toward the Muslim faith."},{"id":"7260d0a8-69b0-4000-af35-52fd65c8ee34","item":"0c7f0f65-972d-4da1-b870-b1079ab96c14","type":"text","html":"<p>“These are the same people who say that if I don’t believe in God I can’t know what morality is,” said Hitchens, making fast work of a half-dozen oysters. “They’ve just dissolved morality completely into relativism by saying actually, occasionally, carving up grandfathers and granddaughters with an ax on New Year’s Eve can be okay if it’s done to protect the reputation of a seventh-century Arabian man who heard voices.”</p>","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"keywords":[]},"text":"“These are the same people who say that if I don’t believe in God I can’t know what morality is,” said Hitchens, making fast work of a half-dozen oysters. “They’ve just dissolved morality completely into relativism by saying actually, occasionally, carving up grandfathers and granddaughters with an ax on New Year’s Eve can be okay if it’s done to protect the reputation of a seventh-century Arabian man who heard voices.”"},{"id":"a6ec6195-ebc6-4170-b1a9-d1257877ec03","item":"0c7f0f65-972d-4da1-b870-b1079ab96c14","type":"text","html":"<p>Hitchens was in Portland for an event for his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00287KD4Q/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1\" data-href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00287KD4Q/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1\"><em>God is Not Great</em></a>.
